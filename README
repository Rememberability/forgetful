A minimal command-line app implementing the SuperMemo 2 algorithm.

The SuperMemo algorithm is designed to refresh your memory at
intervals based on how well you remembered something.

Put question-answer pairs in a file. Everyday, feed the file to forgetful and
it will quiz you on what you need to remember today. Based on your
self-evaluation, forgetful will reschedule at an appropriate time in the
future.

Usage:

  forgetful filename.csv [more filenames]

Format:

A CSV file to contain your questions and answers, in the following format:

  question,answer

Flow:

  1. shows question (press enter)
  2. shows answer
  3. ask for self-evaluation (type number, and enter)
  4. repeat for all questions
  5. repeat for questions that scored less than 4

Self-evaluation:

  5 - perfect response
  4 - correct response after a hesitation
  3 - correct response recalled with serious difficulty
  2 - incorrect response; where the correct one seemed easy to recall
  1 - incorrect response; the correct one remembered
  0 - complete blackout.

WARNING:

Statistics are written back to the input file. This is a feature. Put your CSV
files under source control to keep a history.

Enjoy!
